## 2. TXACC Background and Overview 

### Background 

Texas Association of Charitable Clinics (TXACC) is a private, non-profit organization with a network of over 70 active charitable clinic members across the state who are currently providing healthcare for more than 300,000 underserved Texans. Through training, mentoring, education and advocacy efforts, TXACC aims to strengthen the charitable clinic system in Texas and ensure the best possible care received by Texans who utilize services from this network. 

### The Resource Center 

The Resource Center, as a result, is part of TXACC’s efforts to ease the process of navigating resources for their clinic members and empower the conversations between members and TXACC’s leaders. The proposed Resource Center system will affect the organization in three main aspects: strategy, management, and operations. 

#### 1.   Strategic 
 
With the presence of the Resource Center, participating clinic members can easily get access to learning materials and collaborative tool kits including working templates, discussion room/ group chat, surveys/polls, live videos, how-to-guides, and presentations that connect the members’ conversations and enhance their skillsets in providing high-quality and low-cost care to the underserved Texans. The Resource Center will be a strategically vital platform that helps fulfill TXACC’s main mission of ensuring statewide charitable clinics across Texas have adequate tools for the best possible quality care to those who need it most.
 
#### 2.   Management 

The leadership team and major prospective admins of the platform will find the Resource Center helpful in three major aspects: (1) Communication, Collaboration, and Engagement, (2) Efficiency, and (3) Productivity. Firstly, the online cloud-based collaborative tool kits with group discussion, chat room, and notification features will help effectively cut down the communication lag time between parties, promote cross-collaboration, and invite more engaging conversations between TXACC’s leaders and their clinic members. Secondly, a more organized cloud database with interactive categories and search functions will ease the process of information navigation and administrating training materials and members’ data. Finally, a more user-friendly UX/UI will increase the user experience and engagement with the platform which leads to an increase in productivity and performance of the management team.
 
#### 3.   Operations  
 
The Resource Center will be the centralized database for all questions related to clinics’ training and guidelines where non-management members can visit and search for the information needed. This fastens the communication and operations across teams as information can be searched and issues can be quickly resolved through the platform. For end-users – or participating clinics – the platform will accelerate their communication with TXACC and other in-network members, ease their process of information navigation, and provide them with timely support and toolkits for better performance and experience of providing care.
